instruction schema

Here is what needs to be set in JSON

Maybe the ingredient tble can be used in a different way - when the recipe is saved there can be a query ran that appends the "new" ingredients to the ingredients table.

    $table->increments('id');
    $table->unsignedInteger('ingredient');
    $table->integer('sort');
    $table->double('amount', 8, 2);
    $table->string('amount_desc');
    $table->text('instruction');
    $table->boolean('optional_step');
    $table->timestamps();
